# Messages by Google for macOS

I found out someone have already made one with Electron.js, but whatever this one's coded in Swift.

Alternative project [kelyvin/Google-Messages-For-Desktop](https://github.com/kelyvin/Google-Messages-For-Desktop)

## About

A web app I designed for people who hates launching messaging apps in websites.

You can pair your device normally like you do on your browser.

The application quits when you close the window, so i recommend you to minimize the application if you don't want it to show up on your desktop.

## Installation

[Click here](https://github.com/raymond-1227/GMessages/releases/latest) to download the zip file which includes the app itself.

Just execute the app and login to your Roblox account as usual. Have fun!

## Cannot Open The App?

Since I'm not paying Apple to sign my application, so please follow the steps to start using the app!
1. Go to System Preferences 
2. Go to Security & Privacy > General and click on `Open Anyway`.

You'll only have to do this once after you downloaded and execute the application or updates which I released!

## Note

**This app supports both Intel and Apple Silicon based Macs!** *(insert tim cook wow here)*

This application has only been tested on my Mac, running macOS Monterey 12.3 (Intel Variant), and it's completely safe.
